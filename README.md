Customer Churn Modelling:

A predictive ML model utilizing an Artificial neural network to estimate the probability of a bank customer leaving a bank. Trained on a dataset containing over 10,000 customer records, the model begins by preprocessing the dataâ€”this includes encoding categorical variables and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio. The ANN is constructed using the Sequential function from the Keras module within the TensorFlow library. The architecture comprises one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer, each containing three neurons. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy as the loss function to effectively learn and predict customer churn probabilities. Upon training, the model currently achieves an accuracy of 86.3%.
